Zero Percent Juice is a Johnny Upgrade Style of game where the player is consistently repeating one platformer level with obstacles.

The level is impossible at the start. As the player starts at 0% juice

Over the course of progressing the level and collecting more ingredients they get more and more “juice” progressing towards 100%

Once they get to 100% it becomes possible to beat the level.
